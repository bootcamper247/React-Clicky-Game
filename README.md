# React-Clicky-Game

## Overview
 A memory game built using React. It involves breaking the UI into components, managing component state, and the components responding to user events.

### What the app does

1. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score gets incremented when an image is clicked for the first time. The user's score gets reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
